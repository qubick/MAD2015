Activity Log

I added a 60 by 60 pixels image for icon, but the xcode says it should be 180 by 180 for 3x, 120 by 120 for 2x to created an app icons, resulting in build failed.
(See attached image of error msg)

Instead, added two versions of suggested images to fufill requirements to build, and checked it creates an app icon.
